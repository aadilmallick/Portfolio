            <h1>I'm ready to learn</h1>
            <p>
              I remember it like it was yesterday - June 6th 2021, the day that
              for some reason I fell in love with learning. Maybe it was the
              imposter syndrome talking, telling me that I was the most
              incompetent student in my artificial intelligence class.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              But I remember liking the feeling of getting good at something,
              discovering that you could do something that you couldn't do
              before. The first time I remember loving programming was when I
              pulled out the #1 IDE - notepad - and made my first HTML website.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              So the love of learning was always in within me - but I truly
              unlocked it when I first enrolled the Python Udemy Course by
              Angela Yu, on July 30th 2021.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              And that's where it started. From Udemy to Coursera to Skillshare,
              to thsi very day I am still learning, hoping to grasp the goals
              and dreams before me.
            </p>
            <h2>Hi. I'm Aadil.</h2>
            <p>
              I’m a graduate of Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and
              Technology and am currently attending Willam and Mary. I am
              interested in coding, music, writing, languages, and other topics
              as well. Above all, I’m interested in the topic of learning, and
              how we can learn whatever we want with high quality online
              education.
            </p>
            <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
            <p>
              I originally started coding when I was 12 years old and my parents
              enrolled me in a coding summer camp. Although I was initially
              averse to the notion of doing anything productive, I grew excited
              when I learned I could make my own Pokémon game. And I actually
              did! Except it had no graphics and was only text based. And there
              were only two Pokémon you could battle with. But it was my first
              real project, and it lead my down a path of hopefully lifelong
              learning.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In the summer before senior year, I suddenly became interested in
              real development, like web development and machine learning.
              Although HTML and CSS are pretty easy to get started with, I was
              still elated to etch my html file in the color of body
              <code>{ aquamarine : blue ;}</code>. Along with the help of
              platforms like Udemy and Coursera, I leveled up my web development
              skills. Now I know NodeJS, AJAX, React, Pytorch, MongoDB, and SQL.
            </p>
            <!-- <h2>My Music Journey</h2>
            <h3>guitar</h3>
            <p>
              Music is a big part of my life, as it is for half the world.
              Although I could jam out to my radio all day, something about
              making my own music entranced me. I started the guitar at 12 years
              old along with some of my friends, and the days I spent jamming in
              the guitar elective at my school gave me some of the best memories
              of my life.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              After many years of practice, I learned that consistency is the
              best way to improve in anything. Although I’m not yet where I want
              to be with my guitar playing, I know that over the coming months I
              can constantly improve.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>piano</h3>
            <p>
              My second instrument is the piano, and this one I have a shaky
              past with. Although I started at an early age, I also quit at an
              early age. I was never serious about practicing since I never
              really enjoyed playing songs on the piano. Although it sometimes
              sounded nice, playing felt like a chore since I had no intrinsic
              motivation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              However, during summer 2020, I randomly found a piano music theory
              book and decided to read it since I had nothing better to do
              anyways. That was when I discovered how to make my own music sound
              good. After reading that book, it sparked a blazing fire within me
              that wanted to get better at music seriously. After that, I
              continued with piano and guitar and kept up with them ever since.
